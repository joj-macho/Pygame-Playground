  - [Display Image and Background](handling-images/display_image_2.py): This program displays both an image and a background image on the screen.

- **Simple Animations**:
  - [Animate Moving Image](simple-animations/animate_moving_image.py): This program shows a simple animation by moving an image around the screen.

- **Input Handling**:
  - [Continuous Key Press](input-handling/continuous_key_press.py) - Detects and handles continuous key presses.
  - [On Click Key Press](input-handling/on_click_key_press.py) - Detects and handles key presses on a single click.

- **Collision Detection**:
  - [Collision Detection](collision-detection/collision_detection_1.py): This program shows how to detect collisions between two circles.
  - [Collision Detection with images](collision-detection/collision_detection_2.py): This program shows how to detect collisions between images of a ball and a target.

- **Handling Sound**:
  - [Sound Handling](handling-sound/sound_handling.py) - Plays sound effects.

- **Character Movement**:
  - [Character Movement with Multiple Images](character-movement/move_character_1.py): This program displays character movement by switching between various character images to create the illusion of walking.
  - [Realistic Character Movement with Sprite Sheet](character-movement/move_character_2.py): This program simulates realistic character movement using a sprite sheet to create smooth animation.

### Animations ‚èØÔ∏è
